## Advent of Code and Leetcode
See http://adventofcode.com and http://leetcode.com

These are solutions for the Advent of Code and Leetcode puzzle sets. It's a work in progress, I regularly add new solutions. The solutions are all in Python, split over multiple Jupyter notebook files. 
Some of the solution sets are already complete:
* Advent of Code 2021
* Advent of Code 2022
* Leetcode Top Interview Questions Easy Collection
* Leetcode Top Interview Questions Medium Collection

The Advent of Code puzzles include my personalized input files and ranking files for a few private leaderboards in the data_src folder. The AoC ranking mechanism is time-based and assumes that you'll start on these puzzles the moment they become available (in December of each year). I've added a tool called ```privaterank.py``` to help you determine your (hypothetical, honor-based) ranking on your favorite private leaderboards, even if you do them after the fact. 

NB As the Advent of Code puzzles are time-based, the initial solution to calculate the correct answer is sometimes (often) not very nice-looking. Before pushing the code I clean them up a bit, add comments etc., sometimes try some alternative solutions. Still, not all of them are great examples of software engineering, and for many of them there are probably also more elegant / simpler solutions.
